## Welcome to This Site 

### Work In Progress 

Here are some working papers, for display only. 

### Some Reports

I will try (but no guarantees) to place some works here, if they **meet the standard** and **properly desensitized**. 

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. 
 
For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) or see the [sample](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal/blob/master/index.md).

### Jekyll Themes

This Pages site uses the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme. The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
