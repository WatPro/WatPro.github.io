## Welcome to This Site 

This site is intended to store some materials since 2018. Old programs may also be considered here after review. 

They could include mixure of the followings: 

<dl>
<dt>Data Sources</dt>
<dd>Information collected in different ways, except web crawling machines, data from gray areas and other sources prohibited to disclose. </dd>
<dt>Mathematical Modelling</dt>
<dd>If time allows, TeX documents may be drafted up to explain the fundamental theories. Primary tools consist of Maple, Mathematics, MATLAB, R, Python(TensorFlow etc.) and SAS, but definitely not limited to these. </dd>
<dt>Model Evaluation</dt>
<dd>Validation ensures high quality outputs. </dd>
<dt>Visualization </dt>
<dd>R and Python have many good packages to produce charts, but I would rather rely on <a href="http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Asymptote</a>Â and <a href="https://d3js.org" target="_blank">D3.js</a> to create customized graphs for fine reports. </dd>
</dl> 


### Work In Progress 

Here are some working papers, for display only. 

### Some Reports

I will try (but no guarantees) to place some works here, if they **meet the standard** and are **properly desensitized**. 

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. 
 
For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) or see this [sample](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal/blob/master/index.md).

### Jekyll Themes

This Pages site uses the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme. The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
